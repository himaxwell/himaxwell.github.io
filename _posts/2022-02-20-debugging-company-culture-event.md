excerpt: Join engineering leaders at Maxwell to discuss career growth, learnings, and remote best practices.
---
In the last twelve months as the Maxwell Engineering team has grown by over 170%, we have had to evaluate, experiment, and implement various practices to scale all aspects of engineering.

As a way to share our learnings and learn from others, we are hosting a peer discussion with some of the team members from our Software Engineering team with others in the Engineering community. We will be discussing topics such as our approach to defining software development guidelines, incorporating our version of the Spotify Engineering's ["Guild" model](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/3/243029-spotify-guilds/fulltext){:target="_blank"}, and developing the craft of Engineering Management as a professional development path for Engineers.

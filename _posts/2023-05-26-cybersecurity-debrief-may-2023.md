## Learning -- `CVE-2008-7248`

Today, we tip our hats to Red Hat as we look at `CVE-2008-7248`, which came as an early Christmas present for 2009. First disclosed on December 15, 2009 and earning itself a CVSS score of 6.8/10 (they call that a "medium"), `CVE-2008-7248` took advantage of a "feature" in Rails that feels almost quaint by the battle-worn standards of 2023. The [official Rails blog post](https://rubyonrails.org/2008/11/18/potential-circumvention-of-csrf-protection-in-rails-2-1) reads:

> By design rails does not perform token verification on requests with certain content types not typically generated by browsers. Unfortunately this list also included ‘text/plain’ which can be generated by browsers.

> Requests can be crafted which will circumvent the CSRF protection entirely. Rails does not parse the parameters provided with these requests, but that may not be enough to protect your application.

To review, a CSRF attack occurs when an attacker is able to use a user's pre-existing and legitimate web session on vulnerable website (A) to perform an unauthorized state-changing action on that site.

The classic example is a vulnerable banking website ExampleBank.com where a user has an active session. If an attacker is able to get the user to click a specially-crafted link, it's possible for the attacker to send a request as the user.

For this CVE, Rails was not applying its traditional CSRF protections to requests with the `text/plain` content type, leaving Rails applications open to exploitation should attackers crack how to craft URLs to perform harmful state actions in vulnerable applications.
